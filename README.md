# community-grid
This concept came out of a discussion I had with someone at DwebCamp2022.
The idea being that all conference or community participants could enter their interests and projects and the Community Grid A.I. would recommend 4 people each participant should meet based on the info they provided.
Kind of like an A.I. generated human scavenger hunt for conferences.
Obviously the A.I. recommendation part hasnt been built because I'm not that smart.
If you have some ideas of the logic to match participants based on their inputs, hit me up.
