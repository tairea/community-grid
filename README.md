# community-grid
This concept came out of a discussion I had with someone at DwebCamp2022.
The idea being that all conference or community participants could enter their interests and projects and the Community Grid A.I. would recommend 4 people each participant should meet based on the info they provided.
Kind of like an A.I. generated human scavenger hunt for conferences.
